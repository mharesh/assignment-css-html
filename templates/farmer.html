        <p>A farmer is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or
            raw materials.[2] The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops,
             orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farm land or might work as a laborer on land owned by others. In most developed economies, a "farmer" is usually a farm owner (landowner), while employees of the farm are known as farm workers (or farmhands). However, in other older definitions a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of plants, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish) by labor and attention.
   
           Over half a billion farmers are smallholders, most of whom are in developing countries,
            and who economically support almost two billion people.[3][4] Globally, women constitute
             more than 40% of agricultural employees.[5]</p>
